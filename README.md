## Aero intensity calculator for [DWMBlurGlass](https://github.com/Maplespe/DWMBlurGlass)
Based on the discussion thread [here](https://github.com/Maplespe/DWMBlurGlass/discussions/334) and [this graph and formula](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/t5wh1idedh) made by @ WackyIdeas. The C# program calculates the primary colour, secondary colour (afterglow) and blur balance values for DWMBG based on a 0 to 100 slider and can write them to a DWMBG configuration file, if provided.
